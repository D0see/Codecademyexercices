    <h1>My cheat-sheet</h1>
    <p> the values taken by the display property can be a tad bit confusing, should i use them on the parent element ? (no, but a valid question nonetheless). <br/> Here we will answer every question you would ever ask about those pesky weirdly designed css properties values</p>
    <div class="TableOfContent">
        <ul>
            <li>What are they ?</li>
            <li>Where do they come from?</li>

        <h2>What are they ? :(</h2>
        <p>Formally, the display property sets an element's inner and outer display types. The outer type sets an element's participation in flow layout; the inner type sets the layout of children. Some values of display are fully defined in their own individual specifications; for example the detail of what happens when display: flex is declared is defined in the CSS Flexible Box Model specification.</p>
        <p class="SmolText">here is a bit about some of them</p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>block</th>
                <td>The element generates a block box, generating line breaks both before and after the element when in the normal flow.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>inline</th>
                <td>The element generates one or more inline boxes that do not generate line breaks before or after themselves. In normal flow, the next element will be on the same line if there is space.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>inline-block</th>
                <td>The element generates a block box that will be flowed with surrounding content as if it were a single inline box (behaving much like a replaced element would). It is equivalent to inline flow-root.</td>
            </tr>   
        </table>

        <h2>How to use them ?</h2>
        <p>The display property is a part of the CSS rules that you define for a specific HTML element. You can place it within the CSS block associated with the targeted HTML element.</p>
